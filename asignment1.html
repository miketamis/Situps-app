<h2> The Basic Idea </h2>
<p>The idea is simple, a smart watch app that tracks how many sit ups you
do daily and motivates you towards completing your set goal.</p>


<h2> Similar apps</h2>
after a bit of google I found several apps for both Android and iOS, but none
for any smart watch.

The Android and iOS apps include:
<h3>App 1: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rittr.situps&hl=en">Sit Ups</a></h3>
    Very basic application.
    <h4>Initial Setup:</h4>
    when the user starts the app its asks to select one of four goals: 100, 150, 200 and 250 pushups in a row.
    Then it requires the user todo as many push ups as they can in one set, this is so it can determine where the user is at.
    It also require if the user is male or female.
    <h4> How goals are set:</h4>
    the goals are set manual by the user when they start the application for the first time. Once you have completed the goal, it
    puts you in strength training mode where it just repeat the same group of sets each day and no longer pushes you improve yourself.
    It say that if you want you can reset the application and set a new goal but this means you lose your log :(
    <h4>Daily use:</h4>
    <p>Each day when you go to use the application it presents you with todays workout. This consist of about 4 sets of pushups.
    once started it takes you through each set stating the number of situps you have to do for each set. in between each set it has a
    cool-down timer before the next set.</p>
    <p>After completing all of the sets it asks how you found these sets so it can give you an appropriate number of reps next time.
      This is done by selected one of three options "It was too easy.", "It was just right." and "It was too hard."</p>
    <p>Then the user is presented with a progress screen where they can see how close they are to achieve their goal.</p>
    <h4>Achievement System:</h4>
    <p> Very basic, you can get three different trophy badge that you can post to your facebook wall.
      <ol>
        <li>Bronze: when your 1/3 of the way to your goal.</li>
        <li>Silver: when your 2/3 of the way to your goal.</li>
        <li>Gold: when you have achieved your goal.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <h4> Data: </h4>
    this app collects how many reps you do in each workout and lets you view it as list.
  <h3> App 2: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.northpark.situps">Abs Sit Ups Workout</a></h3>
  Feature packed app. Has lots of sounds. Has the ability to notify you daily/every x days to do your workout.
  <h4>Initial Setup:</h4>
  just requires you todo as many push ups as you can. doesn't require you to set goals or specify sex.
  <h4> How goals are set: </h4>
  <p>you start out at level 1 (or what ever level it puts you at based on your initial push up count): at the end of level 1 you are should be able todo 100 straight push.</br>
  Level 2: at the end you can do 150 straight pushups. </br>
  Level 3: etc....</p>

  <p>each level is broken down in too 3 sub levels. each sub level has a preset workout for you todo each day. </p>
  <h4> Daily use: </h4>
  <p> very similar to App 1: Sit Ups. it alternates between telling you how many sit ups todo and a cool down. It has a cool feature that while you are doing the sit ups
    you can tap the screen to cause the number to go down instead of counting the reps yourself. </p>
  <p> at the end of the work out it asks you the same three questions as App 1: "It was too easy.", "It was just right." and "It was too hard."
    too easy cause you to go up a sublevel, just right keeps you on your current sublevel, too hard drops you down a sublevel.
  </p>
  <h4>Achievement System:</h4>
   Doesnt have one.
  <h4> Data: </h4>
  <p> Has the ability to sync with Google Fit. Although all it sync is calories burnt, doesnt sync reps etc </p>
  <p> has ability to see the number of reps completed and Calories burn on a graph. </p>
  <p> lets you backup the data to sdcard and dropbox </p>

  <h3> App 3: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.runtastic.android.situp.lite">Runtastic Sit-Ups Trainer Plan</a></h3>
    One of Runtastics many apps and therefore integrates nicely with there ecosystem.
    <h4>Initial Setup:</h4>
    Requires your height and weight, but it can get this from your runtatistic account if you have one. Doesn't require you todo any initial push ups and therefore
    starts you off really easy (really anoying).
    <h4> How goals are set: </h4>
    <p>Levels System: </br>
    level 1: 20 push ups in a row </br>
    level 2: 60 push ups in a row </br>
    level 3: 100 push ups in a row </p>
    <p>each level is broken down in to 9 days where on the 9th day you only do one set where that one set is the levels goal. e.g. 20 push ups in a row. </p>
    <h4> Daily use: </h4>
    <p> Same as the others, except for it use the accelerometer in your phone to automatically count down and on the last set of the workout it lets you push yourself to
      see how many more sit ups you can do </p>
    <h4>Achievement System:</h4>
    <p> has badges that you can earn for doing various different things i.e. total number of sit ups.
      Each badge has multiple levels i.e. do 1,000 push ups since you started then 2,000. </p>
    <p> it has also has a leader board where it shows you agianst the rest of the world and your friends </p>
    <h4> Data: </h4>
    <p> Nice statistics, total situps, average situps per day, calories burnt, etc. Has pretty graphs. </p>
    <p> Uploads all the data to your runtastic account </p>
