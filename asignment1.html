<h2> The Basic Idea </h2>
<p>The idea is simple, a smart watch app that tracks how many sit ups you
do daily and motivates you towards completing your set goal.</p>


<h2> Similar apps</h2>
after a bit of google I found several apps for both Android and iOS, but none
for any smart watch.

The Android and iOS apps include:
<h3>App 1: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rittr.situps&hl=en">Sit Ups</a></h3>
    Very basic application.
    <h4>Initial Setup:</h4>
    when the user starts the app its asks to select one of four goals: 100, 150, 200 and 250 pushups in a row.
    Then it requires the user todo as many push ups as they can in one set, this is so it can determine where the user is at.
    It also require if the user is male or female.
    <h4> How goals are set:</h4>
    the goals are set manual by the user when they start the application for the first time. Once you have completed the goal, it
    puts you in strength training mode where it just repeat the same group of sets each day and no longer pushes you improve yourself.
    It say that if you want you can reset the application and set a new goal but this means you lose your log :(
    <h4>Daily use:</h4>
    <p>Each day when you go to use the application it presents you with todays workout. This consist of about 4 sets of pushups.
    once started it takes you through each set stating the number of situps you have to do for each set. in between each set it has a
    cool-down timer before the next set.</p>
    <p>After completing all of the sets it asks how you found these sets so it can give you an appropriate number of reps next time.
      This is done by selected one of three options "It was too easy.", "It was just right." and "It was too hard."</p>
    <p>Then the user is presented with a progress screen where they can see how close they are to achieve their goal.</p>
    <h4>Achievement System:</h4>
    <p> Very basic, you can get three different trophy badge that you can post to your facebook wall.
      <ol>
        <li>Bronze: when your 1/3 of the way to your goal.</li>
        <li>Silver: when your 2/3 of the way to your goal.</li>
        <li>Gold: when you have achieved your goal.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <h4> Data: </h4>
    this app collects how many reps you do in each workout and lets you view it as list.
  <h3> App 2: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.northpark.situps">Abs Sit Ups Workout</a></h3>
  Feature packed app. Has lots of sounds. Has the ability to notify you daily/every x days to do your workout.
  <h4>Initial Setup:</h4>
  just requires you todo as many push ups as you can. doesn't require you to set goals or specify sex.
  <h4> How goals are set: </h4>
  <p>you start out at level 1 (or what ever level it puts you at based on your initial push up count): at the end of level 1 you are should be able todo 100 straight push.</br>
  Level 2: at the end you can do 150 straight pushups. </br>
  Level 3: etc....</p>

  <p>each level is broken down in too 3 sub levels. each sub level has a preset workout for you todo each day. </p>
  <h4> Daily use: </h4>
  <p> very similar to App 1: Sit Ups. it alternates between telling you how many sit ups todo and a cool down. It has a cool feature that while you are doing the sit ups
    you can tap the screen to cause the number to go down instead of counting the reps yourself. </p>
  <p> at the end of the work out it asks you the same three questions as App 1: "It was too easy.", "It was just right." and "It was too hard."
    too easy cause you to go up a sublevel, just right keeps you on your current sublevel, too hard drops you down a sublevel.
  </p>
  <h4>Achievement System:</h4>
   Doesnt have one.
  <h4> Data: </h4>
  <p> Has the ability to sync with Google Fit. Although all it sync is calories burnt, doesnt sync reps etc </p>
  <p> has ability to see the number of reps completed and Calories burn on a graph. </p>
  <p> lets you backup the data to sdcard and dropbox </p>

  <h3> App 3: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.runtastic.android.situp.lite">Runtastic Sit-Ups Trainer Plan</a></h3>
    One of Runtastics many apps and therefore integrates nicely with there ecosystem.
    <h4>Initial Setup:</h4>
    Requires your height and weight, but it can get this from your runtatistic account if you have one. Doesn't require you todo any initial push ups and therefore
    starts you off really easy (really anoying).
    <h4> How goals are set: </h4>
    <p>Levels System: </br>
    level 1: 20 push ups in a row </br>
    level 2: 60 push ups in a row </br>
    level 3: 100 push ups in a row </p>
    <p>each level is broken down in to 9 days where on the 9th day you only do one set where that one set is the levels goal. e.g. 20 push ups in a row. </p>
    <h4> Daily use: </h4>
    <p> Same as the others, except for it use the accelerometer in your phone to automatically count down and on the last set of the workout it lets you push yourself to
      see how many more sit ups you can do </p>
    <h4>Achievement System:</h4>
    <p> has badges that you can earn for doing various different things i.e. total number of sit ups.
      Each badge has multiple levels i.e. do 1,000 push ups since you started then 2,000. </p>
    <p> it has also has a leader board where it shows you agianst the rest of the world and your friends </p>
    <h4> Data: </h4>
    <p> Nice statistics, total situps, average situps per day, calories burnt, etc. Has pretty graphs. </p>
    <p> Uploads all the data to your runtastic account </p>

    <h2> Emulator Plan </h2>
    <p> To keep things simple I'm going to have the emulator function very similar to <a href="https://getpebble.com/pebble_time"> Pebble Time.</a>
      This has several advantages, one its functionality are very simple and two I have one so it will help with visualizing real world application. </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>The screen will be 144px by 168px and wont be touch. </li>
        <li> No sound output </li>
        <li> It will be able to vibrate </li>
        <li> It will have four buttons, one on the left (Back Button) and three on the right(Top, Middle and Bottom Button)</li>
        <li> 3-Axis Accelerometer </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <img src="pebble_watch.png">
    <h2> App Plan </h2>
    <p> I'm going to use the workout schedule found on <a href="twohundredsitups.com">twohundredsitups.com </a> </p>
    <p> The following sketch show the rough app flow: </p>
    <img src="sketch.png" width="800px">
    <p>When you open the app for the very first time you are present with the "Welcome" screen. Once the user hits the middle button they
      are taken to the "age" selection menu. </p>
    <p>The "age" selection screen gives you three options which correspond to the ages in
      <a href="http://www.twohundredsitups.com/test.html">twohundredsitups.com initial test.</a>
      Clicking top button sets the age to "under 30", clicking middle button sets the age to "30 to 39" and clicking bottom button set
      the age to "40 plus". It then take you to the "initial amount" test. </p>
    <p> The "initial amount" amount screen wants you todo as many push up as you can, and then enter it, top button increase the amount, bottom decrease the amount.
      Middle button sets the amount and takes you to the main "menu". </p>
    <p> The main menu is where you can find everything, for a starter all we need is settings and start. When you select start it will take you to the sit up screen.
    to get back to the main menu from anywhere you can hold down the Back Button</p>
    <p> The "sit ups" screen will indicate how many sit ups you must perform, the progress bar at the top will show where you are at, dots indicate sit ups and arrows indicate
      rests. once the user has finished all their sit ups they hit the middle button to move on, which takes them to the "rest" screen. </p>
    <p> The "rest" screen has how many seconds left you have to rest for. It will also have a pie chart in the background to give some visual feedback. If the user decides they
      don't want to rest the can skip the rest by clicking the middle button. </p>
    <p> Once you have completed all of your sets, you will be presented with the "done" screen, where you get three options, if you select "Too easy" you go up an exercise,
      if you select "Just right" you stay on the current exersize, if you chose "Too hard" you go down an exersize </p>

    <h2> Future Plans </h2>
    Things to add if I have enough time:
    <ul>
      <li> Using the accelerometer to count the sit ups </li>
      <li> Ability to set daily/x day alerts to work out </li>
      <li> Achievements </li>
      <li> Previous workouts </li>
      <li> graph of workouts </li>
      <li> ability to change some parameters in settings i.e. rest length </li>
    </ul>



    <h2> Version Control </h2>
    Git - because git is awesome, I have been using it for a while, most ide support it, easy branching, etc... </br>
    Github - because its free, easy to use, has an issue tracker and I have an account. <a href="https://github.com/miketamis/Situps-app">Github project.</a>

    <h2> Languages, Frameworks and IDE </h2>
    <h3> What I'm going with and why </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Html - because I am use to it and the alternatives don't add much value</li>
      <li> TypeScript - because its javascript (which i'm use too) but smarter, it has types to
         prevent you from silly mistakes at the start, and with a decent IDE it will do intelligent
         autocomplete. </li>
      <li> Sass - because it CSS that just better, variables, nesting, extending, etc... </li>
      <li> yeoman - because it helps me get started really quickly with all the frameworks and languages I want. </li>
      <li> Browerify - lets me use the same structor you would in a node.js project (which I love) but for a webapp </li>
      <li> Gulp - build tool of choice, will handle all the compiling of typescript, sass, browserify, etc </li>
      <li> Bower - dependency manager to get stuff for webapp e.g. JQuery </li>
      <li> NPM - dependency manager for build tools and for some stuff used it webapp </li>
      <li> jQuery - because its a must have </li>
      <li> React - so I dont really have to manipulate the DOM </li>
      <li> Jest - Unit Testing: because I really like Jasmine and this takes Jasmine to a whole another level </li>
      <li> Browser Sync - Gives me live reloads and CSS injection as well other cool features </li>
      <li> Atom with TypeScripter - Because I like Atom (and know all the keyboard shortcuts and workflow) and Typescripter makes working with typescript fun </li>
      <li> Chrome Dev Tools - Because it the least frustrating and I know how to use it; also you can blackbox files (e.g. JQuery) so that when you step through
      code you only see your code and not JQuery, Firebug doesn't have this and I feel as if its a killer feature</li>
      <li> Source Tree - awesome GUI for git </li>
    </ul>
    <h3> What I'm not going with and why </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Eclipse - because it clunky, really clunky </li>
      <li> Sublime - because its typescript plugin isnt as fully featured as Atoms. </li>
      <li> Webstorm - Really liked the look of it but I went with Atom because thats what im use too and webstorm
        didn't look like it was much better </li>
      <li> Brackets - used this for a while and loved it, but it was really buggy and therefore sometimes unusable </li>
      <li> CoffeeScript - because I feel like its just javascript just a little simpler but not worth it when it means JS code you find
        online isn't instantly usable and it doesn't have types like typescript </li>
      <li> Jasmine - because Jest has Jasmine and doesnt require me to use PhantomJS because it has a vitural dom </li>
      <li> AngularJS - awesome when your application is super simple but gets really annoying todo some more complex stuff </li>
      <li> Dart - because I didn't want to learn a new language, and most tools etc out there are made for JS </li>
    </ul>
